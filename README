templeton, a minimal web framework

Templeton is a script, module, and support files intended for rapid development
of simple web applications.  It's basically a package around web.py which
suggests a common layout and organization for web apps.

Usage:

templeton install <www-data-dir>

  Copies support files (JS, CSS) into a "templeton" directory in <www-data-dir>.
  The latter should be the root of the web site that will serve templeton
  apps, since the template HTML file loads JS and CSS from /templeton.

templeton init <appname>

  Creates a directory named <appname> with "html" and "server" directories
  containing templates.  You should be able to serve up your default app
  by doing

    cd <appname>/server
    python server.py

  Go to http://localhost:8080/ to see the result.  The next steps you'll want
  to do is edit <appname>/server/handlers.py and put in your server-side
  business logic and edit and create the files in <appname>/html to build up
  your client-side logic.
